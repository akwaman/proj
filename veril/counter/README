Simulate a simple counter.v Verilog module using Verilator.
Generate VCD trace dump and use gtkwave to view graphical waveforms.

Verilator converts the Verilog into C++ classes named V<module> and 
puts them into the obj_dir director (.cpp and .h files). A
Makefile (.mk) is also generated for compiling the classes with gcc.

The testbench is written in C++ and named counter_tb.cpp.

The Vmodule class that Verilator created exposes all of the module
inputs and outputs as variables. These can be set directly in the
testbench. For example, setting the clock to 0 then to 1 will trigger
the module's @(posedge clk) blocks.

Verilator simulation will stop when it encounters a $finish() in
the Verilog module or when the testbench calls exit(0).
